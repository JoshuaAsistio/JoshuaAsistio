# About ME

- I got into programming in my first semester of college.
- The language we were thought then was C. I had a great and bad time learning C.
- Great, because the feeling of solving an activity that was given to us was so good which ended up drawing me into coding even more.
- Bad, because I often made typos and forgot semicolons which caused to spend more time than I'd like on the activity but I ended up finishing either way (that's what she said).

- Back then, however, I faced the possibility of not finishing my first year because my father just got laid off of his job and my mother is a housewife.
- That's when I did what many rational person would do: ~~get a job so you could pay for tuition~~ go to youtube and look up "can you become a self-taught developer?"
- A ton of Front end mentor projects and 4 freeCodeCamp curriculums later, I am now starting to apply for my first Front End Developer job.
